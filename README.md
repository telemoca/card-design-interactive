### What I learned

I learned to use JS in real projects, using RegEx to filter which caracters can be used in input fields, enven tough i know my code isn't very clear.

In CSS, using `box-sizing: border-box` to make elements more responsive, and using prefix to ensure compatibility between diffents browsers.
